# External Internship

 During my time as a Digital Investment Management Intern at [KKR](https://www.kkr.com/), I leveraged data analytics to identify customer personas and forecast product sales profitability with 90% accuracy. My internship at HSBC involved constructing trading strategies using EM Credit Default Swaps and developing a machine-learning-based Emerging Market Risk Indicator. At Efund, I refined portfolio optimization processes with Python, handling policy changes and market volatility, while at Aqumon, I improved trading efficiency by 20% through automation and helped design high-frequency trading strategies. These roles have honed my analytical and quantitative skills, enabling me to navigate complex financial environments and deliver impactful results.
