      This study explores the economic development patterns of Chongqing and southern China using a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model. It constructs comprehensive regional economic indicators via a sampling methodology, and applies PCA and time-series dimensionality reduction techniques to train and validate the forecasting model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using data from 2000 to 2019 obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics, financial reports, and regional yearbooks, the model effectively predicts regional GDP trends and reveals meaningful correlations with national development. The proposed framework provides a replicable mechanism for policy-driven regional economic analysis.

[Economic Forecast of the Southern China on BP Neural Network---Taking Chongqing as an Example](https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/icfied-21/125954303#:~:text=The%20back%20propagation%20neural%20network%20model%20of%20comprehensive,with%20the%20overall%20economic%20development%20of%20the%20country.)

Based on the good economic development trends in Chongqing in recent years, the large changes in GDP increments of the subordinate districts and counties, and the gradual attention paid to the characteristics of regional economic regions. This article used the idea of sampling to establish comprehensive economic development indicators. The back propagation neural network model of comprehensive economic development can accurately predict the overall economic development of Chongqing and southern regions in the next five years, and explore its correlation with the overall economic development of the country. Through the application of principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction time series analysis, it fits the relationship between the comprehensive indicator data of Chongqing area from 2000 to 2019 obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics, financial reports and annual reports so as to carry out model training, analysis and prediction. The conclusion from this passage has strong universality in the current situation of regional economic differentiation and commonality. After the promotion and establishment of a mechanism to obtain a regional economic overview by sampling representative cities in various regions, it will greatly promote the formulation and modification of macroeconomic policies.
